# palindromer
generate sentential palindromes with the power of C

Hello! This project is version two of a project I made in high school for a college app. It intends to make strings of words that form perfect palindromes. It doesn't yet follow english grammar, but this is a feature I intend to implement.

In order to use, use make clean, make, ./palindrome 
Se your minimum word length, your starting prefix, or use '0' to start with no prefix. Enjoy!
